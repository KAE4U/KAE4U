- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Pedro!
- I'm looking for my first job in the technology area, all in all, my knowledge is shallow, but I have the time and dedication to learn new things.
- My English is average, I read, write and understand very well, my speaking is a little behind, but with a little practice everything will be resolved.
- I have basic skills in using Python, HTML5 and CSS, but much better in Python, mastering the basics completely.
